# (San Francisco Bay Bike-Sharing Data)
## by (Amangele Oyinmiebi)


## Dataset

> . There are 183411 trip data of San Franscisco Bay Area in the datset with 12 features(start_station_name,end_station_name,bike_id,user_type,member_gender,bike_share_for_all_trip,distance,speed,hours,week,member_age,age_group).The variables are both numeric and string in nature.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration stage, I found a weak positive relationship with speed and distance and that was after I performed a log transformation on the distance. Then I found out the time of the day that people use the system is 7am and 5pm.I also found out that people use the system on monday and on wednesday's. Then I found that there was a strong relationship between age and speed, that the younger people moved with faster speed than the elderly and also gender had an inpact on speed.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I start by showing the distribution of speed. Then show the bar chart of hours and week. Then move on to the bivariate plot, showing the relationship with speed and age_group with a box plot and with hours and week using a clustered bar chart. Finally, showing a multivariate plot of speed, distance and age_group using a scatter plot.
